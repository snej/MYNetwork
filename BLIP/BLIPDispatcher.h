/** Routes BLIP messages to targets based on a series of rules.
 
    Every BLIPConnection has a BLIPDispatcher, which is initially empty, but you can add rules
    to it.
 
    Every BLIPListener also has a dispatcher, which is inherited as the parent by every
    connection that it accepts, so you can add rules to the listener's dispatcher to share them
    between all connections.
 
    It's not necessary to use a dispatcher. Any undispatched requests will be sent to the
    BLIPConnection's delegate's -connection:receivedRequest: method, which can do its own
    custom handling. But it's often easier to use the dispatcher to associate handlers with
    request based on property values. */
