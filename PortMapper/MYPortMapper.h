/*  MYPortMapper attempts to make a particular network port on this computer publicly reachable
    for incoming connections, by "opening a hole" through a Network Address Translator 
    (NAT) or firewall that may be in between the computer and the public Internet.
 
    The port mapping may fail if:
    * the NAT/router/firewall does not support either the UPnP or NAT-PMP protocols;
    * the device doesn't implement the protocols correctly (this happens);
    * the network administrator has disabled port-mapping;
    * there is a second layer of NAT/firewall (this happens in some ISP networks.)
 
    The PortMapper is asynchronous. It will take a nonzero amount of time to set up the
    mapping, and the mapping may change in the future as the network configuration changes.
    To be informed of changes, either use key-value observing to watch the "error" and
    "publicAddress" properties, or observe the MYPortMapperChangedNotification.
 
    Typical usage is to:
    * Start a network service that listens for incoming connections on a port
    * Open a MYPortMapper
    * When the MYPortMapper reports the public address and port of the mapping, you somehow
      notify other peers of that address and port, so they can connect to you.
    * When the MYPortMapper reports changes, you (somehow) notify peers of the changes.
    * When closing the network service, close the MYPortMapper object too.
