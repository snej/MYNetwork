/** Generic TCP-based server that listens for incoming connections on a port.

    For each incoming connection, it creates an instance of (a subclass of) the generic TCP
    client class TCPClient. The -connectionClass property lets you customize which subclass
    to use.
 
    TCPListener supports SSL, Bonjour advertisements for the service, and automatic port renumbering
    if there are conflicts. (The SSL related methods are inherited from TCPEndpoint.) 
 
    You will almost always need to implement the TCPListenerDelegate protocol in your own
    code, and set an instance as the listener's delegate property, in order to be informed
    of important events such as incoming connections. */
